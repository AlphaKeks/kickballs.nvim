# Kickballs.nvim

This is a starting point for your own neovim configuration! You are encouraged to fork this
repository and make it your own. Read the comments, read the manual (`:help`) and most imporantly:
read the fucking manual

# Installation

To install kickballs run the following command in a terminal:

```sh
$ git clone "https://github.com/TheBallsUp/kickballs.nvim.git" ~/.config/kickballs
```

Then you can run it by setting the `NVIM_APPNAME` environment variable to `kickballs` before running
nvim. This is useful to try it out without breaking your current config. If you want to replace your
current config, just clone the repo into your actual config directory.

```sh
$ NVIM_APPNAME=kickballs nvim
```
